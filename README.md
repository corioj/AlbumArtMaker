# AlbumArtMaker
This project implemented several different generative-adversarial network structures in order to generate genre-based album covers from random noise within the PyTorch framework.

Album artwork training data was scraped from Spotify using a Python script before being engineered and formatted for optimal usage within the Google Colab setup. 

Three different neural networks were coded and tested (Multi-class Embedded CGAN, Multi-class Embedded Linear CGAN, Single-Class DCGANs). The different GAN setups were implemented based on previous knowledge, adjacent computer vision research publications, and individual tweaks. Then, they were trained, evaluated, and set to work to produce original album artwork.
